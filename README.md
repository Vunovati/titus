## Installation

###Â Lerna

The monorepo is setup using lerna, so you'll first need to install it as a global dependency

```
npm install --global lerna
or
yarn global add lerna
```

### Bootstrap

To install dependencies for all packages, and link any cross-dependencies, we need to bootstrap them.

```
lerna bootstrap
```
